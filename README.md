Using Fisheriris and Ionosphere datasets

# Experiment 1

➢ Visualize data.

➢ Split the datasets randomly into a training (80 %) and a test set (20 %).

Using linear SVM, report:
Accuracy, precision, and recall, F1score, TPR, FPR.

➢ Scale datasets using standardization:
Compute the mean and standard deviation of each feature (i.e., over a column in the training set).
Then subtract the mean from each value and divide each value by the standard deviation.
Then, split the datasets into a training (80%) and a test set (20 %).

Using linear SVM, report:
Accuracy, precision, and recall, F1-score, TPR, FPR.

# Experiment 2

➢ Split the datasets randomly into a training (80 %) and a test set (20 %).

Use linear SVM, Decision Tree, kNN methods report:
Accuracy, precision, and recall, F1-score, TPR, FPR.
For each classification method calculate confusion matrix.

# Experiment 3

➢ Use linear SVM, Decision Tree, kNN methods.

Implement k-fold Cross-Validation then calculate:
precision and recall values for k=5,6,7,8,9,10 and plot these values.

# Experiment 4

➢ Use linear SVM, Decision Tree, kNN methods.
Split the datasets randomly into a training (80 %) and a test set (20 %).
Plot the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for the classifiers (score values can be use as parameter).

2 ROC curves:
1-> Precison-Recall
2-> TPR-FPR

# Experiment 5

➢ Use kMeans method

Split the datasets randomly into a training (80 %) and a test set (20 %).

Report:
Accuracy, precision, and recall, F1-score, TPR, FPR.
Visualize data and cluster centers.

➢ Use kMeans method

Split the datasets randomly into a training (80 %) and a test set (20 %).

Calculate:
Precision and recall values for k=1,2,3,4,5,6.
For all k values visualize data and cluster centers.

# Experiment 6

➢ Split the datasets randomly into a training (80 %) and a test set (20 %).

For each dataset calculate:
Training time and prediction time for SVM, Decision Tree, kNN and kMeans.

Give these values with a table as below.
